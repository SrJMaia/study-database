DBMS -> Database Management Systems
	- A special software program that helps users create and maintain a da	tabase
	- Makes it easy to maanage large amounts of information
	- Handles Security
	- Backup
	- Importing/exporting data
	- Concurrency
	- Interacts with sofware applications: programming languages

CRUD -> Create Read/Retrive Update Delete
	- The four main operations in the database


Two Types of Databases

Relational Databases (SQL) -> Like excel
	- Organize data into one or more tables
		- Each table has columns and rows
		- A unique key identifies each row
Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
	- Help users create and maintain a relational database: mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB
Structured Query Language (SQL)
	- Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
	- Used to perform CRUD operations, as well as other administrative tasks (user management, security, backup, etc)
	- Used to define tables and structures
	- SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification

Non-Relational (noSQL/not just SQL)
	- Organize data is anything but a traditional table
		- Key-values stores
		- Documents (JSON, XML, etc)
		- Graphs
		- Flexible Tables
Non-Relational Databases (noSQL / not just SQL)
	- Non-Relational Database Management Systems (NRDBMS)
		- Help users create and maintain a non-relational database: mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase
- Implementation Specific
	- Any non-relational database fails under this category, so there's no set language standard
	- Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing CRUD and administrative operations on the database
	

Database Queries

Queries are requests made to the database management system for a specific information
As the database's structure become more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specfic pieces of information we want
A google search is a query


Primary Key

A unique value, dont repeat. Surrogate key, can start in any value or maybe use e-mail/document
Surrogate Key -> Its a primary key that has no mapping in the real word: index where start in any number and dont repeat
Natural Key -> There is a mapping in the real word, email or document
Foreign Key -> Its an attribute that link to another table
Composite Key -> Two keys combined become a primary key


Structured Query Languages (SQL)

SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
	- You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you
		- Create, retrieve, update and delete data
		- Create and manage databases
		- Design and create databases tables
		Perform administration taks (security, user management, import, export)
	- SQL implementations vary between systems
		- Not all RDBMS' follow the SQL standard to a "T"
		- The concepts are the same but the implementation may varyyo
		
SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one
	- Data Query Language (DQL)
		- Used to query the database for information
		- Get information that is already store there
	- Data Definition Language (DDL)
		- Used for defining database schemas
	- Data Control Language (DCL)
		- Used for defining database schemas
	- Data Control Language (DCL)
		- Used for controlling access to the data in the database
		- User and permissions amanagement
	- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
		- Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the databases
		

Queries

A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written is SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you
	- TONS of data in a DB
	- Often hidden in a complex schema
	- Goal is to only get the data you need
	- Example: SELECT employee.name, employee.age FROM employee WHERE employee.salary > 30000;
